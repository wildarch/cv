%	WORK EXPERIENCE SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Work}
\cventry{09/2019 -- 07/2021}{Software Engineer}{Google LLC}{London}{}{
    As part of the Display Ads Monetization team, developed the pipeline for calculation and disbursement of advertising revenue to AdSense and YouTube partners.
    The system I personally designed and built processed well over 1 billion USD monthly, and was a mission-critical part of the pipeline.
    In response to concerns about exceeding our time budget, I spearheaded an initiative to speed up our pipeline, and reduced execution time six-fold.
    Next to my core responsibilities, I have also taught introduction classes to the \href{https://www.rust-lang.org/}{Rust programming language} and contributed to the \href{https://v8.dev/}{V8 JavaScript compiler} that powers Google Chrome.
}
\cventry{09/2018 -- 05/2019}{Designer}{Prodrive Technologies B.V.}{Eindhoven}{\url{prodrive-technologies.com}}{
    Embedded Software Designer for 2 months.
    Switched to newly created DevInfra team to assess the viability of the Rust programming language for use at Prodrive and promote it.
    Developed various applications in the Embedded and Networking domains.
}

\section{Notable Projects}
\cventry{11/2022 -- 02/2023}{Superg}{TU Eindhoven}{Eindhoven}{\url{github.com/wildarch/superg}}{
    Built modern equivalents of the \href{http://miranda.org.uk/}{Miranda} and \href{https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/tigre/index.html}{TIGRE} execution engines for functional programming languages.
    Thanks to the use of a recently-proposed compilation algorithm, the worst case performance is exponentially better than previous Combinator Reduction Engines.
    We show that while TIGRE outperformed Miranda significantly at the time of publication, on modern x86 CPUs it suffers from frequent cache invalidation, and is not a good choice anymore.
    Final course grade 10/10.
    Currently investigating a venue for publication.
}

\cventry{04/2022 -- 02/2023}{ByzzFuzz}{TU Delft}{Delft}{\url{doi.org/10.1145/3586053}}{
    Designed a fuzz testing harness for a the Tendermint blockchain.
    I demonstrated a mismatch between the concensus protocol and message delivery subsystem, which can cause cluster to deadlock if certain messages are dropped.
    Paper accepted for \href{https://2023.splashcon.org/details/splash-2023-oopsla/27/Randomized-Testing-of-Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant-Algorithms}{OOPSLA 2023}.
}

\cventry{02/2022 -- 04/2022}{Compiled Selection Predicates in AvantGraph Database}{TU Eindhoven}{Eindhoven}{}{
    Designed a Just-in-time compilation scheme for the AvantGraph database that combines performance with maintainability.
    The JIT compiler, based on LLVM, accepts ordinary C++ functions and specializes them at runtime to reduce branching and pointer indirection.
    I implemented compilation of selection predicates using the JIT, and demonstrated performance improvements in multiple queries from the \href{https://github.com/ldbc/lsqb}{LSQB} benchmark.
    Final course grade 9/10.
}

\section{Honors}
\cventry{06/2016 -- 09/2018}{Honors Program High Tech Systems}{TU Eindhoven}{Eindhoven}{}{
    Special program for the top 100 students of the university to take on a extra project next to their studies.
    Built a low-latency drone position-tracking system based on image recognition.
    At our industry partner Avular, I ported their position tracking system from Matlab to C++ and Cuda to run it locally on the drone, achieving a 4x speedup.
    Received the rare "Excellent" distinction for my efforts (highest awarded).

\section{Interests}
\cvitem{Travelling}{
    I love to step outside of my comfort zone and try new things.
    Not only does this drive me to experiment with new technologies and unfamiliar programming languages, it is also a motivation to travel to countries that are very different from the Netherlands, such as Azerbaijan, and embrace different cultures.
    This summer my thirst for culture shocks will take me on a three month solo trip to Asia from Hong Kong to Malaysia.
